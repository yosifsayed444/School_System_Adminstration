# School_System_Adminstration
I recently developed a simple School Management System using C++ and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.
The system allows adding students, teachers, and courses, while linking each course with a specific teacher and multiple students.

Throughout this project, I applied key OOP concepts:

Inheritance to reuse and extend code

Encapsulation to organize and protect data

Polymorphism.

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of how OOP can be applied in real-world scenarios and how to build a complete system step by step.
